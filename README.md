# LazyVim-Shell-Script

### Shell Script to install lazyvim and dependencies.

I'll update it and insert 42header.
This script don't need of sudo user to install asdf and dependencies.
It use asdf pack manager to download all as needed to use it. So, may take several minutes to finish script.

Added a script just for add 42header plugin (LazyVim and lazy plugin manager)

Actual version working just in 42school machine... Future updates will handle all machines `linux`
